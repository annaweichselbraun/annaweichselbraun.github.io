Language, Culture, and Semiotic Practice
Here I focus on how meaning is made in everyday life. Students learn to analyze linguistic and communicative practices using tools from linguistic anthropology and semiotics. We read classic and contemporary texts and explore how language ideologies shape institutions and technologies.
